# Jokedle ReactJS Web Front End

## Developed by Cade Gray

## Version 0.1.0 Beta

## Game Rules

- Start by picking 5 random letters. From there guess 1 letter each turn.
- If the letter is incorrect when guessing as single letter, a life is lost.
- If all lives are lost, the game is over. To win, must pick all letters in punchline.

## Goals for Version 1.0

- [] Ability for gussing entire punchline instead of 1 letter each.
- [] Custom Keyboard instead of using default, especially good for mobile.
